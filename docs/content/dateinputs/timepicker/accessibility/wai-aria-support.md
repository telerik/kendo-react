# TimePicker Accessibility



Out of the box, the Kendo React TimePicker provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TimePicker is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### TimePicker Wrapping Element

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=combobox` | The input element should follow the `combobox` specification. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-required=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TimePicker is in a `form` HTML element and announces the required state of the component. |
|  | `aria-describedby=.k-form-hint id/.k-form-error id` | Points to the hint for the input, or if the input is invalid, to the error message. This attribute should only be present when a hint is set or when the input is invalid. |
|  | `aria-expanded=true/false` | Announces whether the Popup is visible or not. |
|  | `aria-haspopup=dialog` | Indicates the component has a Dialog Popup. |
|  | `aria-controls=.k-animation-container id` | Points to the popup element. Signifies that the `combobox` element controls the `dialog` popup. |
|  | `readonly` or `aria-readonly` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is readonly. |
| `.k-invalid .k-input-inner,.ng-invalid .k-input-inner` | `aria-invalid=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the picker is in form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is disabled. |
| `.k-input-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | The element must either be a `<button>` element or must have `role=button` assigned. |
|  | `aria-label` | The button needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `tabindex=-1` | Button element must not be focusable. |

### List Elements on the Popup

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-time-list` | `role=listbox` | The timelist elements must have `listbox` role assigned. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The listbox needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
| `.k-reset` | `role=none/presentation` | The k-rest `<ul>` element semantic meaning must be removed from the accessibility tree. |
| `.k-item` | `role=option` | The available options in the listbox must be marked as such. |
|  | `aria-selected=true/false` | Selected option must have its `aria-selected` attribute set to `true`. |
