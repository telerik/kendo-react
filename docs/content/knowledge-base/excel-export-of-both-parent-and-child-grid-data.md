## Description

I have a parent Grid with child Grids as details, how to export all to Excel.

## Solution

This requires using a chain of Promises to request the data for all child Grids and append it to the exported document after each parent row item.

This is an example showcasing this. The example contains comments for the most specific parts:

{% meta height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/excel-export-parent-child/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/excel-export-parent-child/main.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
