## Description

I want to add button in the Grid's toolbar for clearing all filters

## Solution

For achieving the desired result a Button component can be placed within the GridToolbar and within its click event the filter object of the DataState stored in the state can be set to null

This is an example showcasing how to limit the value:

{% meta height:360 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-add-clear-filters-button/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-add-clear-filters-button/main.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
