# Breadcrumb Accessibility



Out of the box, the Kendo React Breadcrumb provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Breadcrumb is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Breadcrumb component renders the semantic `nav` html element that automatically associated navigation role.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-breadcrumb` | `aria-label=Breadcrumb` | Indicates the type of navigation provided by the `nav` element. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-item .k-breadcrumb-link,.k-breadcrumb-item .k-breadcrumb-root-link` | `role=link` or `nodeName=a` | The breadcrumb item should render either an `<a>` element, or should have `role="link"` assigned. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-link,.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-root-link` | `aria-current=page` | The last breadcrumb item that points to the active page should have `aria-current="page"`. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-link` | `aria-disabled=true` | Indicates that the last breadcrumb item is disabled. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-delimiter-icon` | `aria-hidden=true` | The breadcrumb delimiter icon should not be accessed through assistive technology. |
