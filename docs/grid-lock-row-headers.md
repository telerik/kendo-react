## Description

How can I add a locked section header that changes when I scroll through the data similar to the ComboBox grouping headers.

## Solution

This will required the following:

1. The section/header rows have to be part of the data.
1. We can add a field in those data items and lock the rows based on that. The locked row of the current section/group will be locked at the top.

> This approach is working with flat data and grouping on only one level. As the section/group data is part of the flat data we have to filter it based on that section value in order to collapse/expand the sections.

The following example showcase this in action:

{% meta id height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/lock-row-headers/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file shared/products-with-sections.json %}
{% endmeta %}
