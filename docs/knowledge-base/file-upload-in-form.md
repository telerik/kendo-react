## Description

How can I use the Upload component inside a Form?

## Solution

In order to achieve this, the Upload files data has to be added to the Form data and then submitted programmatically to the server.

{% embed_file form/file-upload/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file form/file-upload/main.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
