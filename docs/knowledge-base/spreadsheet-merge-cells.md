## Description

I want to merge the cells of a spreadsheet using a custom tool.

## Solution

To merge cells in a KendoReact Spreadsheet, first create a custom `MergeCellsButton` component and pass it to the [toolbar]({% slug api_spreadsheet_spreadsheetprops %}#toc-toolbar) prop of the Spreadsheet component. Inside `MergeCellsButton`, use the `spreadsheetRef` to access the spreadsheet instance. From this instance, retrieve the currently active sheet using the `activeSheet()` method. Then, get the selected cell range using the `selection()` method, pass it to `range()` to define the cells, and call `merge()` to combine them. This functionality is triggered when the `MergeCellsButton` is clicked.
