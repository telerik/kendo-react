Maybe warning?\r\nWhy? because any browser extension in any browser can replace any node and this will lead to broken application.\r\nOtherwise documentation should be improved and state clearly that fragment is unsafe to use if there is a chance of third party DOM modification. (I understand why it is happening in the first place, but not agree that it should).\r\nAlso it would be great to include DOM path into original error if possible, because for example we create captured this error using sentry and it is unclear where it is happening and it\u2019s quite hard to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

It also could have the second parameter optional, making it organize the return by an object that would return all children separated by type.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\nThis example is not complete and should not be compared to the final proposal function\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nfunction byType (children, type : string) {\r\n    return React.Children.map(children, child => type == child.type.name? child:null);\r\n}\r\n```",

              "state": "OPEN",
              "number": 16009,
              "body": "I think we need to rethink how focus works in React. React Flare is the perfection opportunity to allow us to do this, so here are some of my thoughts. None of these ideas wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the great ideas from @sebmarkbage, @devongovett and @necolas have had. Furthermore, the discussions in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16000, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15848 and https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15849 got me thinking on a better system.\r\n\r\n## Focus is a mess on the DOM, so let's not use the DOM\r\n\r\nFocusing on the DOM is a mess today. We couple ideas around ideas around things like `tabIndex` and whether a specific browser treats something as focusable. This is very much a hard-coded disaster where no one really agrees on a good formula for success. Not to mention, that this just doesn't translate well for a declarative UI. How does one tab to a specific node that isn't focusable? How does one use keyboard arrows to navigate a table using keyboard arrows?\r\n\r\nThen there's implementation. Without relying on an attribute on an element or a `ref`, it's very hard to say: \"Hey look, let's focus to this node, given this criteria\". Not to mention the performance overhead of doing this: querying or \"collecting\" focusable elements is an expensive O(n) task, which doesn't scale for large applications well. I noticed that wrapping the an internal large app with `<FocusScope>` and then collecting all focusable nodes took over 850ms on Android using Chrome. Querying the DOM nodes took even longer.\r\n\r\nLastly, we can't use the DOM with React Native and the story for handling focus with React Flare is important. If we instead had a React system for handling focus, then both the web and RN would be consistent and performant.\r\n\r\n## Accessible components\r\n\r\nWe already have the `<Focus>` and `<FocusScope>` event components. We could extend on React Flare and introduce a way of layering accessibility logic on to host components. In this I introduce a new API called `createAccessibleComponent`, but really it could be anything \u2013 ignore the naming! This is purely hypothetical discussion for now.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// input is not focusable\r\n<FocusScope>\r\n  <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Enter your username\" /> \r\n</FocusScope>\r\n\r\nconst FocusableInput = ReactDOM.createAccessibleComponent((props, focusable) => {\r\n  return <input tabIndex={focusable ? 0 : -1} {...props} />;\r\n});\r\n\r\n// now it's focusable\r\n<FocusScope>\r\n  <FocusableInput\r\n    type=\"text\"\r\n    placeholder=\"Enter your username\"\r\n    focusable={true}\r\n  />\r\n</FocusScope>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't use a `FocusScope`, then the normal DOM behaviour will continue to work as expected. `FocusScope` will only care about these new types of accessible component.\r\n\r\n## The focus manager should be encapsulated and relative to `FocusScope`\r\n\r\nIn order for focus management to be powerful, it needs to be baked into React. Event responders like `FocusScope` can let the manager know what scope it should be interacting with given a particular `<Focus>` that focuses occur in. `FocusScope` will also fully override the browser tabbing behaviour (like it does now) to ensure tabbing works as expected:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { focusManager } from 'react-events/focus';\r\n\r\nfocusManager.getFocusedNode();\r\nfocusManager.getFocusedId();\r\nfocusManager.focusFirst(isRTL?: boolean = false);\r\nfocusManager.focusLast(isRTL?: boolean = false);\r\nfocusManager.focusPrevious(fromId?: string, isRTL?: boolean = false);\r\nfocusManager.focusNext(fromId?: string, isRTL?: boolean = false, );\r\nfocusManager.focusById(id: string);\r\n\r\nconst FocusableDiv = ReactDOM.createAccessibleComponent((props, focusable) => {\r\n  return <div tabIndex={focusable ? 0 : -1} {...props} />;\r\n});\r\n\r\n<FocusScope onMount={() => focusManager.focusFirst()}>\r\n  <FocusableDiv focusable={true} />\r\n  <FocusableDiv focusable={true} />\r\n  <div tabIndex={0}>You can't focus this</div>\r\n</FocusScope>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFocusing by `focusId` will propagate until an `focusId` is found. So this would matter for cases such:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst FocusableDiv = ReactDOM.createAccessibleComponent((props, focusable, focusId) => {\r\n  return <div tabIndex={focusable ? 0 : -1} {...props} />;\r\n});\r\n\r\n<FocusScope>\r\n  <FocusableDiv focusable={true} focusId=\"focus-me\" />\r\n  <FocusScope>\r\n    <FocusableDiv focusable={true} focusId=\"focus-me\" />\r\n  </FocusScope>\r\n</FocusScope>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `focusManager.focusById('focus-me);` was used on the inner `FocusScope`, it would focus the inner button. If used on the outer `FocusScope`, it would focus the outer button. If the outer `FocusScope` didn't have an id that matched, then it would propagate the lookup to the inner `FocusScope`.\r\n\r\nDoing this, it makes it possible to apply keyboard navigation:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction handleKeyPress(key) {\r\n  if (isValidArrowKey(key)) {\r\n    const currentId = focusManager.getFocusedId();\r\n    const nextId = findNextId(currentId, key);\r\n    focusManager.focusById(nextId);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<FocusScope onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}>\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"AA\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"AB\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"AC\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"BA\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"BB\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"BC\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"CA\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"CB\" />\r\n  <FocousableCell focusable={true} focusId=\"CC\" />\r\n</FocusScope>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, `<FocusScope>`s can also have `focusId`s that allows you to move focus to a specific scope. That particular event component can then act upon receiving focus `<FocusScope onFocus={...}>`.\r\n\r\n## It can simplify `<Focus>`\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Focus onFocus={...}>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <FocusableDiv focusable={true} />\r\n  </div>\r\n</Focus>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore, focus would only be of the direct child of the `<Focus>` component. This made it somewhat problematic when you wanted to find the focusable element that was not a direct child. Focus no longer needs to be coupled with \"bubbling up\" through the DOM, but rather it bubbles from accessible component to event components. So doing this, will still result in the nearest focusable child being passed to the `Focus`:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Focus onFocus={...}>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <FocusableDiv focusable={true}>\r\n      <FocusableDiv focusable={true} />\r\n    </FocusableDiv>\r\n  </div>\r\n</Focus>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## This can be fast too\r\n\r\nIn terms of performance, we can actually fast-path how this all works because we're no longer using the DOM, but event components within the Flare event system. We'd have optimized data collections that ensure that the least possible time is taken traversing focusable elements by leveraging a separate internal data structure that is separate from the Fiber and DOM structures. The cost is that this will take additional memory and time to construct when a focus scope gets mounted/unmounted. Given this shouldn't be a rapid event, it's worth the trade-off.\r\n\r\nAlso, given we're not wrapping `FocusScope` with a context provider (as mentioned in the FocusManager PR), which should get improved performance from not needing to do context lookups and traversals.\r\n\r\n## `Focus` and `FocusScope`, `focusManager`\r\n\r\nGiven that they now share underlying implementation details, they all should come from the same module. So going forward, it makes sense to import them all form `react-events/focus`.\r\n\r\nThe nice benefit from this is that this actually fixes a bunch of issues with the current implementation, where we can't use `FocusScope` as a hooked event component. With the changes outlined in this issue, it should allow for them to be used via the `useEvent` hook.\r\n\r\n## We can build in great dev tooling around the focus system\r\n\r\nWe can build in great support for debugging in React Dev Tools when working with focus and \r\nthis will help improve accessibility within apps that use `<Focus>`, `<FocusScope>` and `focusManager`. Plus it would support any future APIs that add accessibility benefits to components.",

              "body": "Proposal:\r\n\r\nThe most top level component, like an `App.js` can create a global state store like Redux that all child components can access with a method like: `setGlobalState()`.\r\nNot with props or callback functions passed into props.\r\n\r\nRedux is a bit complex to achieve a task of global state across components and is hard for people to learn and understand. At the high level of React development, most people are using Redux. It would be cool if we could include the functionality of Redux natively into React with a simpler set of methods.\r\n\r\nMy Idea:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nconstructor(props){\r\n   this.state = {\r\n       // normal local component state as already implemented\r\n   }\r\n   this.globalState = {\r\n      // only 1 instance of globalState can be declared in application, preferably in the most top- \r\n      level component.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.setState() // uses local component state, as already implemented\r\n.setGlobalState() // uses most top level component state, ex. `App.js`\r\nthis.state.foobar // normal access of state\r\nthis.globalState.foobar // global level access \r\n```\r\n\r\nRoast me if this won't work or it's a bad idea, but I'd be interested in seeing if this could be done and would be of valuable to the project.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n`react`: `16.8.6`\r\n`react-dom`: `16.8.6`\r\n`react-test-renderer`: `16.8.6`\r\n`@testing-library/react`: `8.0.4`\r\n",

For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { default as React, setState, useCallback } from 'react';\r\nimport { TextField } from '@component';\r\n\r\nconst SomeComponent = (props) => {\r\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('');\r\n \r\n const handleChange = useCallback((e) => setValue(e.target.value), []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <TextField onChange={handleChange} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm tired to write handleChange everywhere when `TextField` had used... I want make this case simpliest.\r\n\r\nCan I pass `setValue` to TextField as a props (instead adding onChange) and implement setting value inside of TextField?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// ...\r\n  <TextField valueDispatcher={setValue} />\r\n//...\r\n```",

Otherwise, we run into the continued problem that some component using local state can't be serialized/undone.\r\n\r\nI've contemplated trying to pry open the internals of React and patching useState myself to experiment adding these features, but wanted to open up an issue first to see what current thoughts were on providing these functions at the framework level.",

              "number": 16073,
              "body": "I have the following hook:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction usePromise ( promise ) {\r\n\r\n  let [result, setResult] = useState ({ loading: true });\r\n\r\n  useMemo ( () => {\r\n\r\n    result = { loading: true };\r\n    setResult ( result );\r\n\r\n    promise.then ( value => setResult ({ loading: false, value }) )\r\n           .catch ( error => setResult ({ loading: false, error }) );\r\n\r\n  }, [promise] );\r\n\r\n  return result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt accepts a promise and returns an object that tells you if the promise did resolve/reject or if it did not settle yet. I think this is a fairly common pattern.\r\n\r\nFirst of all notice how I'm using `useMemo`, as we want to attach `then`/`catch` handlers only once.\r\n\r\nSecondly notice how inside `useMemo` I'm resetting the `result` object whenever the promise changes, as we don't want it to return the previous result object instead.\r\n\r\nI'm resetting the `result` object both permanently, via `setResult`, and temporarily, by assigning to it directly. I believe the direct assignment is necessary here because otherwise my component will immediately receive the previous `result` object instead of the new one.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple issues even with this fairly simple hook:\r\n\r\n### 1 - Inappropriate linter warning\r\n\r\nThe linter is complaining about assigning directly to `result` with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssignments to the 'result' variable from inside React Hook useMemo will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the '.current' property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useMemo.eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I'm also using `setResult` here this issue seems none existent, maybe this warning shouldn't be displayed in this situation?\r\n\r\n### 2 - Missing linter warning\r\n\r\nIf I don't update the `result` variable immediately by directly assigning to it my component will initially receive the wrong object, which is an error, and I think it will also be rendered twice, once with the wrong object, and a second time with the right one once `setResult` does its job.\r\n\r\nShouldn't in situations like this be a linter rule that _encourages_, instead of discourages, you to also update the value directly in order to avoid those issues?\r\n\r\n### 3 - Updating state while the component is unmounted\r\n\r\nI think my `usePromise` hook will eventually call `setResult` while the component is unmounted because the promise will eventually resolve/reject after the component has been unmounted.\r\n\r\nSo I'll have to update it to check if the component is still mounted, otherwise React will log an error about this.\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of this error? Why can't/shouldn't React itself just ignore my `setResult` call if the component is not mounted? Or at the very least why is React logging an error about this and not a warning?\r\n\r\nI find myself stumbling into this issue pretty often, perhaps a linter rule can be written about this?\r\n\r\n### 4 - Which hook to use?\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding this correctly instead of `useMemo` I could have used `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` and have gotten _almost_ the same result, I say almost because:\r\n\r\n- `useMemo` calls the passed function immediately, which is want we want or the promise may throw an exception that we won't be able to catch.\r\n- `useLayoutEffect` would call the passed function at a later time, right before the browser is ready to render the frame, or at least I believe that's the case, but if I have 10 `useLayoutEffect` calls and the first one keeps the main thread busy for 1 minute are the other 9 always going to get executed before the browser paints?\r\n- `useEffect` will call the passed function at a point in time that's not very clear to me. (e.g. should it be equivalent to `componentDidMount` + `componentWillUnmount`? Or was it `componentWillMount` + `componentDidUnmount` or some other permutation?)\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are 3 built-in hooks that could be used for this, which may not reveal any error for a long time, is a bit confusing to me.\r\n\r\n### General feedback\r\n\r\nI've recently migrated an app of mine to hooks and this particular issue has bit me more than once already, I keep stumbling upon it. In general I'm having troubles writing reliable custom hooks and components.\r\n\r\n1. There's no linter rule that reminds me to also update the value provided by `useState` hooks immediately, in fact it seems the current one discourages it.\r\n2. I think my components have become harder to reason about sometimes: \r\n\t- If I call `setFoo` 10 times is my component going to render 10 times?\r\n\t- Will React re-render my component also if I pass `setFoo` the same exact value as before?\r\n\t- If I use `useState` 3 times, and call the related `set*` methods from inside 3 `useEffect` hooks, one for each, is my component going to render 4 times if the first `useEffect` block relies on and updates the value provided by the first `useState`, the second `useEffect` block relies on the value provided by the first `useState` call too and updates the second, and the third `useEffect` block relies on the value provided by the second `useState` call and updates the third? And shouldn't I try to minimize these renderings by updating those values via an assignment also? \r\n\t- I basically use `useEffect` by default, but some times I see a bit of flickering/glitches in the UI, I replace it with `useLayoutEffect` instead, the issue gets fixed, and I notice that I'm actually mutating the DOM or something inside the hook.\r\n\t\t- I find this to be quite error-prone for me, as sometimes it's not clear that I'm actually mutating the DOM (say I want to update the `scrollTop` property of an element or something), as the line that actually does that may be abstracted away by some other high-level API.\r\n\t\t- I also find the mere existence of 2 effect-related hooks confusing, I think I understand under which scenarios `useLayoutEffect` should be used, and that it's called before the browser paints the new frame, but then when is my `useEffect` hook called? Is it always called after `useLayoutEffect`? What would happen if I replaced all my `useEffect` calls with `useLayoutEffect` calls instead?\r\n3. Generally hooks seem like a very good abstraction to me, but writing custom ones seems too error prone to me. I'm pretty new to hooks overall, but I think I'm relatively experienced as a developer, but if even writing a relatively simple one, like the `usePromise` hook I posted, has so many pitfalls to be aware of maybe this is an issue? I realize this sounds a bit like blaming the language for the bugs I've introduced, but perhaps there's a way to make this process less error prone? i.e. new/improved linter rules, less ambiguity (`useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`), clearer lifecycle (when is `useEffect` even called? are my components re-rendering an unexpected amount of times?), no need to update values directly (hypothetically maybe they should be proxies so that `set*` functions can update them immediately or something? I realize that proxies aren't polyfillable but there might be other ways around it), no need for specifying dependencies (the code might be statically analyzable at build-time most of the times).\r\n\r\nIn hindsight maybe this \"General feedback\" section is a bit off-topic, let me know if you guys want me to move that into a separate issue.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long issue, hopefully it's helpful.",

              "body": "This issue is a summary of issues mentioned in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15157.\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways to create memory leaks with React since we give you access to the imperative power to do so. Most should be dealt with by clean up / unmount functions.\r\n\r\nSome could be pure React bugs. Some could be related to the lack of clean up of render phase effects. Others could be related to leaks that exists but the way React works makes them larger than they otherwise would've.\r\n\r\n# Actionable\r\n\r\nI think there are at least two actionable patterns to address from #15157:\r\n\r\n- [ ] If a handle on a DOM node is leaked, it takes the React tree with it. This is a fairly easy mistake to make and the effect is pretty high. What we would do here is special case DOM nodes with refs on them, and always detach their back pointer to the React Fiber, if it was ever fully mounted. We currently traverse these trees anyway when they get deleted. We want to stop doing this for most things but for nodes with a ref it seems minor to special case since they typically need to be invoked with null anyway.\r\n- [ ] Investigate the source of the leak in https://github.com/jonnycornwell/potential_react_leak and fix the source of the problem.\r\n\r\n# Unresolved\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closing over setState/dispatch or class component instances to global state can leak too. Does this pattern warrant special casing too? Under what conditions?\r\n- [ ] Land https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15157 What patterns are actually covered? It can cut down on a potentially larger leak but is that the whole leak? I could imagine some patterns where this is the complete solution but unclear if it's the complete solution for the patterns that people are actually hitting in practice.\r\n- [ ] What other issues remain after solving the actionable above? Let's make another pass investigating if people's original issues remain.\r\n\r\n# Won't Fix\r\n\r\n- Side-effects in class constructor, componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, componentWillUpdate, getDerivedStateFrom... and render that store a reference to anything stateful outside React won't be able to clean up. This is [documented](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html) in the 16.3 release and is a major design decision as part of the concurrent/suspense/error handling strategy.\r\n- Effects/state retained temporarily in alternate fiber likely won't be fixed short term. This is due to how Fiber uses two trees and swaps between them. This can lead to additional values being retained until that tree gets some work on it to swap again. This was observed in the Hooks release and there are some confusing cases where a destroy function can hold onto more memory than expected in the closure. Typically this is solved by using a custom hook since that gets its own scope/closure.\r\n- Props/child trees retained by alternate children. Similarly, children that was just removed can sometimes between retained by the alternate copy of that. That is until that node gets another update on it which clears out the old children. These cases are fairly unusual and fix themselves eventually as the app lives on.",

              "number": 16091,
              "body": "Firstly, sorry for putting a question in the issues tracker, since I'm not sure where to put this.\r\n\r\nI really love the concept of hooks & have been converting many class components to hooks. One of the common problems I usually get with hooks, is to access the latest state/props in `useEffect` and `useCallback`, while avoiding specify too many dependencies to these hooks. \r\n\r\n(I'm aware of exhausive deps, but for optimization, I don't want `useEffect` to be called too many times, or `useCallback` to return a different function every times)\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to maintain the identity of function returned from `useCallback`, so I'd need to put `[]` as 2nd argument (because I'm gonna pass it to a component inside `React.memo` and don't want to write custom props comparator). So it'd be like this:\r\n```js\r\nuseCallback(() => doStuff(value1, value2), [])\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course it won't work because `doStuff` will always receive initial value of `value1` and `value2`. That's why I'd need to use `useRef`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ref = useRef({ value1, value2 });\r\nref.current = { value1, value2 };\r\nuseCallback(() => doStuff(ref.current.value1, ref.current.value2), [])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd could say that this happens so many time that I decided to write a custom hook for it :)\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function useCallbackWithRef<TRef, TCb extends (...args: any[]) => any>(\r\n  refData: TRef,\r\n  callback: (refData: TRef) => TCb\r\n): TCb {\r\n  const ref = React.useRef(refData);\r\n  ref.current = refData;\r\n  return React.useCallback((...args: any[]) => {\r\n    return callback(ref.current)(...args);\r\n  }, []) as TCb;\r\n}\r\n\r\n//usage\r\nuseCallbackWithRef({ value1, value2 }, ref => () => doStuff(ref.value1, ref.value2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it seems to work quite nice: [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/white-brook-1myr7)\r\n\r\nI'm going to use this across many places in my project, but I don't want to have many regrets later on so I just want to ask a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Is there any performance issue with excessive use of `useRef`? Since they're just pointer to an already exist object, I guess it's not going to have any memory impact?\r\n2. I read somewhere that React may decide to re-compute value in `useMemo` if needed, even if I specify `[]` as dependencies. Is it better if I change the implementation to `useState` with lazy init, instead of `useCallback`?\r\n3. Or is there a much more simpler, a true React way to achieve what I want but I have overlooked?",

Especially it is critical on huge application with thousands elements which updates several times per second.  Virtual DOM in React provides good help for performance issues, but sometimes you need to go further and operate on level of vanilla js with incremental changes and custom virtual DOM model relevant to your application. For now the only way to do it is to use refs, but it is looks kind of ugly. Allow to return HTML elements will helps to solve this issue in elegant and intuitive way.",

Immediately after the upgrade, with no other changes except bumping our `react` and `react-dom` packages, we saw a 1-2s TTI increase on many of our pages for users browsing with Chrome and Firefox (specifically, not Safari). This represents a ~15-50% increase in TTI for a few of our pages.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to tell exactly what the issue is given the size and complexity of our app. We noticed that React spends a lot of time instantiating `FiberNode` classes, but haven't really found anything that stands out. We also noticed the TTI increase going from 16.2 to 16.5. 16.3 does not increase our TTI.\r\n\r\nFor some additional context: The TTI metric we use is a custom metric, defined per page. The default definition is wait until mount of the root container, fire a 0ms `setTimeout`, and mark when that resolves. Some pages wait until a certain API response arrives or an async component mounts, then fire a 0ms `setTimeout` and mark when that resolves. \r\n\r\nWe'll keep updating this thread as we collect more information, but wanted to see if anyone had run into a similar issue.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

I know the rationale behind this is to encourage use of the function component pattern, and allow for future optimization work in the form of precompilation. However, it makes it very inconvenient to use modern hooks-based libraries in class components, and you're essentially forced to resort to using a higher order component instead, if one is even provided. \r\nFor instance, included with the react-i18next library is a very convenient `useTranslation` hook, yet, if you're localizing class components, you must wrap everything with a HOC, since the library no longer includes a decorator. The HOC pattern is especially nasty with Typescript since you essentially have to add a bunch of extra properties to your component's props interface and then have the HOC function strip them with a compound type.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

It even works with custom hooks provided by third party libraries, since the built-in hooks they call are wrapped. We're currently using this with the `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next with no issues. \r\nI can't see any reason why this shouldn't be available natively, if only for compatibility and migration purposes. Render methods are just functions, and hooks are simply a way to allow repeated function calls to access persistent state from a backing list, correct? The hooks API documentation states that you shouldn't bother to refactor all your class components just for hooks, and even if that sort of usage wouldn't be possible to optimize through precompilation, allowing it would significantly ease the transition.\r\nThe only potential caveat is the common class component pattern of delegating out to subordinate render methods, in which hooks wouldn't work properly if they're called conditionally or in a loop. This can be avoided by passing hooked values from the top level render method instead.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nEvery version since hooks were added, 16.8.0 and up, all browsers obviously.",

              "body": "First of all, I am aware that `react-cache` package is highly experimental and unstable, but I still would like to experiment and express my thoughts on the subject. (skip to the end for the actual question)\r\n\r\nI've tried using it in several fun projects, and in my experience current version works pretty well with anything static, e.g. resources that need to be loaded only once, or can be loaded once and updated separately.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all resources are like that, and some of them need cache invalidation.  This https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14783#issuecomment-461860954 mentions that there is no API for invalidation, but you can actually invalidate the resource, using the clever hash function. I've put together a little [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-cache-stale-while-revalidate-startegy-0o9jj).\r\n\r\nThe problem with that approach is that invalidations happens \"soundly\" and will trigger the suspense. \r\n\r\nThis could be solved by busting the cache only after the `preload` of the next entry already happened, but there's unfortunately no way to track the `preload` state of the next entry, since the `preload` method actually doesn't return the promise it called;\r\n\r\nAnother way to go around this issue is to have a side effect inside the async resource, that would cause a re-render when completed, thus giving the ability to invalidate the old entry only after the new entry has been completed;\r\n\r\nLastly there\u2019s the ability to create a invalidation method, wrapping a `read` method in a try-catch block and have custom logic of resolving with a result / awaiting  a suspender. This however makes the invalidation async, but it's probably fine, since we only need to invalidate the cache after we already have the initial result and can update the result when the invalidation has already happened.\r\n\r\nSince the first approach is basically impossible with current cache package and later two required a lot of custom logic, one would probably be better of writing an entirely custom suspender and cache provider with a required strategy.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long read, thus comes the question:\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** Is `react-cache` being developed and presented as a low-level API for writing custom resource caching logic OR as an example of writing custom suspenders and cache strategies?",

Every single question I found on Stack Overflow about this invariant was someone not understanding how JSX works and calling `.setState()` in `.render()`, which isn't at all what I'm doing.  I don't understand why the detection for _infinite_ loops is set to such a low threshold.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, `NESTED_UPDATE_LIMIT` should be at least 10x higher.  It'll still catch infinite loops just fine, and won't take much longer to do so, but won't kick my ass for having the audacity to use several libraries and a reasonably deep structure.\r\n\r\nFailing that, it should be configurable.  As I said, I'm using expo, which I believe means there's no way for me to change this value when publishing my app.  I can edit it in `node_modules/` just fine on my local machine (and the error goes away of course), but with no way to do so on the build servers, I can't make this app.  Not with react, anyway.  I really don't want that to be the case, because I've been building this for months, at this point, and starting over in swift or whatever would be an awful cost to my employers just because someone thought \"50 is enough for anyone\".  :/\r\n\r\nAs it seems like the expo bootstrapping layers are being ignored, I'm going to start diving in to that code now to see if I can steal its ideas, but of course I shouldn't have to.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@expo/browser-polyfill\": \"0.0.1-alpha.3\",\r\n    \"@expo/vector-icons\": \"10.0.1\",\r\n    \"@react-navigation/core\": \"3.3.1\",\r\n    \"airbnb-prop-types\": \"2.13.2\",\r\n    \"axios\": \"0.18.0\",\r\n    \"buffer\": \"5.2.1\",\r\n    \"expo\": \"33.0.0\",\r\n    \"expo-constants\": \"5.0.1\",\r\n    \"expo-gl\": \"5.0.1\",\r\n    \"expo-web-browser\": \"5.0.3\",\r\n    \"lodash\": \"4.17.11\",\r\n    \"moment\": \"2.24.0\",\r\n    \"path\": \"0.12.7\",\r\n    \"pixi.js\": \"4.7.0\",\r\n    \"prop-types\": \"15.7.2\",\r\n    \"react\": \"16.8.4\",\r\n    \"react-moment-proptypes\": \"1.6.0\",\r\n    \"react-native\": \"https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-33.0.0.tar.gz\",\r\n    \"react-navigation\": \"3.11.0\",\r\n    \"react-navigation-redux-helpers\": \"3.0.2\",\r\n    \"react-redux\": \"7.1.0\",\r\n    \"react-switch-case\": \"1.0.6\",\r\n    \"redux\": \"4.0.1\",\r\n    \"redux-form\": \"8.2.1\",\r\n    \"redux-persist\": \"5.10.0\",\r\n    \"redux-persist-expo-securestore\": \"2.0.0\",\r\n    \"redux-thunk\": \"2.3.0\",\r\n    \"reselect\": \"4.0.0\",\r\n    \"whatwg-url\": \"7.0.0\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinux Mint 18, iOS 12.2.

However, in some cases you may want to avoid re-triggering the callback ref when one of those external values change. In that case, you could use `useRef` to work around this, and update the ref's value with `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst valueRef = useRef(value);\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  valueRef.current = value;\r\n}, [value]);\r\n\r\n// Now the callback ref can use `valueRef.current`\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, callback refs are called before `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` callbacks, so if the callback ref happens to be triggered as a result of the same render in which `value` changes, it will see the old value when it access `valueRef.current`.\r\n\r\nThis could be worked around by updating `valueRef` as a side effect of render:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst valueRef = useRef(value);\r\nvalueRef.current = value;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly a very specific edge case, but I have actually introduced bugs into real code due to this, when trying to convert existing class components to use hooks. Another motivation for this is to use it to help implement a custom hook for making callback refs nicer to use by mimicking the `useEffect` API: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15176#issuecomment-512185852\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this issue does not happen with class components, because `this.props` and `this.state` have the correct value when the callback ref is triggered.\r\n\r\nHere is a codesandbox with a contrived example that reproduces the issue (and shows how the issue does not occur with a class component): https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-refhooks-72m3p\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat there is some way of handling this use case using hooks, and in such a way that works with concurrent mode:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Wanting to access external values in a callback ref\r\n\u2022 Wanting to avoid triggering the callback ref when those values change\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

So I have a sort of pivot grid component with quite heavy state and a GridCell (uncontrolled or semi-controlled) component which is basically one number input. So the value and onChange are cycled through it's state and in parent component I'm handling just onBlur. So in order to do some validation when users enter unacceptable value I notify them and then I want to reset the cell by resetting prevState. [Here](https://codesandbox.io/s/musing-mclaren-qvclh) is a simplified reproduction of the problem.\r\n",
