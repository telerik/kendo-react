## Description

How to show the number of characters as the user types and set a maxLength for the Chat component?

## Solution

To set a `maxLength` render a custom [`Input`]({% slug overview_textbox %}) component and set the value for the [`maxLength`]({% slug api_inputs_input %}#toc-maxLength) prop to the preferred value. To see the character count as the user types, display the [`value`]({% slug api_inputs_input %}#toc-value) variable in the custom component markup. For more information on how to customize the Chat component refer to the [`customization`]({% slug custom-rendering_chat %})
